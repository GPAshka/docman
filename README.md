## What is docman?

Docman is the sample project written in .NET Core 3.1 to demonstrate how main functional programming and DDD techniques can be combined in the C# code.
The domain tackles a simplified document management which revolves around the changing document statuses.

## Architecture overview

The referencing application uses monolith architecture model. Underneath it relies heavily on the following patterns:
[CQRS](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/cqrs.html) and [Event sourcing](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-sourcing.html).
Write (command) side uses [EventStore DB](https://www.eventstore.com) to store events. Read (query) side uses [PostgreSQL DB](https://www.postgresql.org) to return data to the client.

### Handling commands

Commands are the earliest source of data. Commands are sent to the application by users and are handled by the command side, which does the following:  

1. When a command is received, the current state of the affected entity is computed from its history.
2. The command is turned into an event and applied to the entityâ€™s state, obtaining its new state.
3. The event is persisted and published to interested parties for further processing.

## How to start the solution?
From the root directory execute:

`docker-compose up -d`

This command will start required infrastructure. Then you can start Docman application using `dotnet run` command from the `src/Docman.API` folder.

## What HTTP requests can be sent to the docman application?
You can find the list of all HTTP requests in [Docman.rest](https://github.com/GPAshka/docman/blob/master/Docman.rest) file placed in the root folder of the repository. 
This file is compatible with [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) plugin for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

Document requests should be sent in the following order:
1. Create document
2. Update document or add file
3. Send for approval
4. Approve document or reject document
